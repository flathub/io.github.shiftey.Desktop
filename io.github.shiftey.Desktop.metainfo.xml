      Focus on what matters instead of fighting with Git. Whether you're new to Git or a seasoned user, GitHub Desktop simplifies your development workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attribute commits with collaborators easily. Quickly add co-authors to your commit. Great for pairing and excellent for sending a little love/credit to that special someone who helped fix that gnarly bug of yours. See the attribution on the history page, undo an accidental attribution, and see the co-authors on github.com
    </p>
    <p>
      Checkout branches with pull requests and view CI statuses. See all open pull requests for your repositories and check them out as if they were a local branch, even if they're from upstream branches or forks. See which pull requests pass commit status checks, too!]
    </p>
    <p>
      Syntax highlighted diffs. The new GitHub Desktop supports syntax highlighting when viewing diffs for a variety of different languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expanded image diff support. Easily compare changed images. See the before and after, swipe or fade between the two, or look at just the changed parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extensive editor & shell integrations. Open your favorite editor or shell from the app, or jump back to GitHub Desktop from your shell. GitHub Desktop is your springboard for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community supported. GitHub Desktop is open source now! Check out our roadmap, contribute, and help us make collaboration even easier.
